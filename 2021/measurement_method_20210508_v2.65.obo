def: "Active avoidance requires performing a specific behavior in order to escape or avoid the aversive stimulus. It is a conditioning paradigm in which the animal learns to control the application of an unconditioned stimulus (US), in this case, a foot shock, by appropriately reacting to a conditioned stimulus (CS) preceding the US, such as a light cue. The first stage of avoidance learning is usually to escape from the US. With continued training, anticipatory reactions appear which enable the animal to avoid the US altogether. In the active avoidance test, the rodent is placed into a shuttle box and is trained to move to the opposite side of the box in response to a cue that signals an incoming foot shock. Movement to the opposite side of the chamber in response to the presentation of the shock-predictive cue alone is regarded as active avoidance, whereas movement to the opposite side of the chamber only after receiving foot shock is regarded as an escape response."

The passive avoidance task is be carried out in a shuttle box with a light chamber and a dark chamber separated by a doorway (the step-through version of the task). Given that illuminated environments are unpleasant to rodents, when placed in the light chamber, they are led into the preferred dark compartment by its innate photophobia. During habituation, theyre allowed to do so, but in the conditioning phase of the passive avoidance test, the animal will receive a foot shock when he crosses to the dark chamber. His innate behavior of seeking a darker environment will thereby become associated with an aversive stimulus. When placed again in the light chamber, the animal will avoid entering the dark, shock-associated chamber." [https://conductscience.com/maze/portfolio/active-passive-avoidance-shuttle-box/ "Website"]

def: "A computed tomography (CT) technique that uses a low radiation dose to measure bone mineral density (BMD) of a bone after removal from the body and possibly after removal of the surrounding tissues such as the muscle, utilizing a calibration standard (\"phantoms\") to convert the Hounsfield Units (HU) of the CT image to BMD values. CT is a method of producing images of single tissue planes in which the emergent X-ray beam is measured by a scintillation counter and the electronic impulses are recorded on a magnetic disk and processed by a mini-computer for reconstruction display of the body in cross-section."

comment: Peripheral quantitative computed tomography can be performed on bones in vivo as well as excised bones. This term, being in the "ex vivo method" branch of the MMO, does not cover in vivo usage of the technique.

def: "A method of assessing the amount of albumin, the major blood plasma protein which is responsible for much of the plasma colloidal osmotic pressure and which serves as a transport protein for large organic anions such as fatty acids and bilirubin, in a specified sample of urine, the fluid waste product excreted by the kidneys. This method uses a technique in which the dye bromocresol green is incubated with the sample and the resulting color change is evaluated based on the ability of the solution to alter the transmission of light at specific wavelengths in the visible spectrum, that is, to alter the transmission of a specific color of light. Bromocresol green is a dye of the triphenylmethane family that forms a colored complex specifically with albumin. The intensity of the color is directly proportional to the albumin concentration in the sample."

def: "Any of a group of analytical separation techniques used to analyze volatile substances in the gas phase. In gas chromatography, the components of a sample are dissolved in a solvent and vaporized in order to separate the analytes by distributing the sample between two phases: a stationary phase and a mobile phase. The mobile phase is a chemically inert gas that serves to carry the molecules of the analyte through the heated column; the stationary phase can be either a solid adsorbant or a liquid on an inert support."

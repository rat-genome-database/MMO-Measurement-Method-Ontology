def: "A method in which the subject's weight is measured in air and underwater to determine density of the body and from that calculate percentage body fat. In general the subject sits in a specialized weighing chair and is lowered into a tank of water after expelling all air from the lungs and once all body parts are submerged, the weight is taken. The general formula is the density of the body divided by the density of the water is equal to the weight of the body in air divided by the weight of the body in air minus the weight of the immersed body."
